# MomentFitting
This software package contains a basic implementation of the hierarchical
moment-fitting approach first presented in the following publication:
MÃ¼ller, Kummer, Oberlack: Highly accurate surface and volume integration on
implicit domains by means of moment-fitting.

The implementation considers the construction of quadrature rules for a
single quadrilateral cell K = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1] which is cut by the zero
iso-contour of a level set function.

Use the functions 'getSurfaceRule' and 'getVolumeRule' to obtain a set of
quadrature nodes and weights for the integration over the zero iso-contour and
the positive sub-volume (w.r.t. the level set function), respectively. Use the
Matlab test runner 'runtests' to execute the basic verification tests in
'surfaceTest.m' and 'volumeTest.m', which also serve as usage examples.
